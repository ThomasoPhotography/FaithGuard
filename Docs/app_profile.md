FaithGuard targets Christians aged 18-45 who are struggling with pornography addiction and seeking a compassionate, non-judgmental path to recovery. This includes individuals from various walks of life—professionals, students, parents—who value faith-based solutions over secular approaches, and who desire personalized, actionable guidance to rebuild their spiritual lives and relationships.
