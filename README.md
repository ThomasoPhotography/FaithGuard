# FaithGuard

FaithGuard is currently a small static website / front-end project that provides a clean, responsive landing page and assets for a web presence. The project includes HTML, SCSS/CSS, and a simple file structure that makes it easy to develop, preview, and deploy.

**Highlights**
- **Simple**: Static site built with plain HTML and CSS/SCSS.
- **Organized assets**: Styles are in `assets/css/` including `style.scss` and the compiled `style.css`.
- **Easy to run**: Open `index.html` locally or use a lightweight static server to preview.

## Features
- Static, responsive layout suitable for a landing page.
- SCSS source with compiled CSS for easy styling and customization.

## Getting started
- To preview locally, simply open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or run a simple static server (recommended if you use modules or want a nicer dev workflow):

## Development
- Edit the SCSS source `assets/css/style.scss`. Recompile to `style.css` with your preferred tool (Dart Sass, node-sass, or your editor integration).

## Project structure
- `index.html` — Main page
- `assets/css/style.scss` — SCSS source
- `assets/css/style.css` — Compiled stylesheet
- `assets/` — Other static assets (images, fonts, etc.)

## Future Development Plans
- `index.html` — Current main page
- `index.php` — Future main page
- SQL for Database
- PHP for backend
- JS for functionality

## Contributing
- Improve content, styles, or accessibility. Open a PR with a clear description.
